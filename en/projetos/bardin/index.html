id=introduction>Introduction</h1><p>The systematic analysis of institutional academic production represents a fundamental challenge for understanding research trends, areas of interest, and the evolution of knowledge in universities. In the context of São Paulo State University (Unesp), with multiple campuses distributed throughout the state of São Paulo, this task becomes even more complex due to the volume and diversity of scientific production.<p>This work addresses the central question: "What have Unesp undergraduate students produced in the last 10 years?". This question unfolds into specific questions about disciplinary preferences, temporal evolution of research topics, geographic distribution of areas of interest, and emerging patterns in academic production.<p>To answer these questions, a computational system was developed that integrates the classic Content Analysis methodology proposed by Laurence Bardin<sup class=footnote-reference id=fr-1-1><a href=#fn-1>1</a></sup> with current deep learning and natural language processing (NLP) techniques. This hybrid approach maintains the methodological rigor of traditional qualitative analysis while enabling the processing of large data volumes through automated algorithms.<p>The main objective of this work is to develop and validate the system applied to Unesp's academic production, specifically the undergraduate theses (TCCs) produced between 2015 and 2024.<p>Specifically, the authors seek to (a) computationally implement the three phases of Bardin's methodology through NLP and machine learning techniques, (b) identify and characterize the main research topics present in the TCCs through automatic topic modeling, (c) analyze the temporal evolution of identified topics, detecting emerging and declining trends, and (d) map the geographic and disciplinary distribution of topics among different campuses and courses.<h1 id=literature-review>Literature Review</h1><h2 id=bardin-s-content-analysis>Bardin's Content Analysis</h2><p>Content Analysis, as systematized by Laurence Bardin<sup class=footnote-reference id=fr-1-2><a href=#fn-1>1</a></sup>, is defined as "a set of communication analysis techniques aimed at obtaining, through systematic and objective procedures for describing message content, indicators (quantitative or not) that allow the inference of knowledge related to the production/reception conditions (inferred variables) of these messages."<p>The methodology is structured in three fundamental phases:<ol><li><p>Pre-analysis: Organization of material and systematization of initial ideas. Includes floating reading, document selection, hypothesis and objective formulation, and indicator development.</p><li><p>Material exploration: Systematic application of decisions made in pre-analysis. Consists essentially of coding, decomposition, or enumeration operations, according to previously formulated rules.</p><li><p>Treatment of results and interpretation: Raw results are processed to be meaningful and valid. Simple or complex statistical operations allow the establishment of result tables, diagrams, figures, and models.</p></ol><h2 id=topic-modeling-and-bertopic>Topic Modeling and BERTopic</h2><p>Topic modeling refers to a family of unsupervised machine learning algorithms designed to discover latent thematic structures in large document collections<sup class=footnote-reference id=fr-2-1><a href=#fn-2>2</a></sup>. Traditionally, methods such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) dominate the field, modeling documents as probabilistic mixtures of topics.<p>BERTopic, introduced by Grootendorst<sup class=footnote-reference id=fr-3-1><a href=#fn-3>3</a></sup>, represents a significant evolution in this area, combining pre-trained language embeddings with clustering techniques to create more coherent and interpretable topic representations. The algorithm follows a modular pipeline:<ol><li><p>Embedding Generation: Use of pre-trained language models (BERT, Sentence-BERT) to create dense vector representations of documents.</p><li><p>Dimensionality Reduction: Application of Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) to reduce embedding dimensionality, preserving local and global structures<sup class=footnote-reference id=fr-4-1><a href=#fn-4>4</a></sup>.</p><li><p>Clustering: Use of Hierarchical Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (HDBSCAN) to identify clusters of semantically similar documents<sup class=footnote-reference id=fr-5-1><a href=#fn-5>5</a></sup>.</p><li><p>Topic Representation: Extraction of representative words through class-based TF-IDF (c-TF-IDF), a variation of traditional TF-IDF<sup class=footnote-reference id=fr-6-1><a href=#fn-6>6</a></sup> adapted for clustering contexts<sup class=footnote-reference id=fr-3-2><a href=#fn-3>3</a></sup>.</p></ol><h2 id=natural-language-processing-in-portuguese>Natural Language Processing in Portuguese</h2><p>Processing texts in Portuguese presents specific challenges related to the language's rich morphology<sup class=footnote-reference id=fr-7-1><a href=#fn-7>7</a></sup>, including complex verbal conjugations, gender and number agreement, and extensive use of clitics. For this work, the spaCy <code>pt_core_news_lg</code> model was used, specifically trained for Brazilian Portuguese, offering tokenization, lemmatization, morphosyntactic analysis, and named entity recognition capabilities<sup class=footnote-reference id=fr-8-1><a href=#fn-8>8</a></sup>.<h1 id=mathematical-foundations-of-algorithms>Mathematical Foundations of Algorithms</h1><h2 id=linguistic-processing-with-spacy>Linguistic Processing with spaCy</h2><p>spaCy implements a linguistic processing pipeline based on convolutional neural networks (CNN). The main operations performed are:<ul><li><p><strong>Tokenization:</strong> Text segmentation into tokens using Portuguese-specific linguistic rules and regular expression patterns. Each document \(D\) is transformed into a sequence of tokens \(T = {t_1, t_2, ..., t_n}\).</p><li><p><strong>Lemmatization:</strong> Reduction of each token to its canonical form (lemma) through a trained statistical model. For each token \(t_i\), lemmatization maps \(\text{lemma}(t_i) = l_i\), where \(l_i\) represents the base form of the word, removing verbal inflections, plurals, and other morphological variations.</p><li><p><strong>Part-of-Speech (POS) Tagging:</strong> spaCy uses a convolutional neural network to classify each token into grammatical categories. The probability of a token \(t_i\) belonging to POS class \(c_j\) is calculated through \(P(c_j \mid t_i) = \text{softmax}(\mathbf{W} \cdot \text{CNN}(t_i) + \mathbf{b})_j\), where \(\mathbf{W}\) are the classification layer weights, \(\text{CNN}(t_i)\) is the token's vector representation, and \(\mathbf{b}\) is the bias vector.</p></ul><h2 id=term-frequency-inverse-document-frequency-tf-idf>Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF)</h2><p>TF-IDF is a statistical measure that evaluates the importance of a term in a document within a corpus. It is calculated as the product of two components:<p><strong>Term Frequency (TF):</strong><p>\[ \text{TF}(t, d) = \frac{f_{t,d}}{\sum_{t' \in d} f_{t',d}} \]<p>where \(f_{t,d}\) is the raw frequency of term \(t\) in document \(d\).<p><strong>Inverse Document Frequency (IDF):</strong><p>\[ \text{IDF}(t, D) = \log\left(\frac{N}{\mid{d \in D : t \in d}\mid}\right) \]<p>where \(N\) is the total number of documents and \(\mid{d \in D : t \in d}\mid\) is the number of documents containing term \(t\).<p>The final TF-IDF is therefore obtained with \(\text{TF-IDF}(t, d, D) = \text{TF}(t, d) \times \text{IDF}(t, D)\). This metric penalizes very frequent terms (like stopwords) and values distinctive terms of specific documents.<h2 id=semantic-embeddings-sentence-transformers>Semantic Embeddings (Sentence-Transformers)</h2><p>The <code>paraphrase-multilingual-mpnet-base-v2</code> model uses a transformer architecture<sup class=footnote-reference id=fr-9-1><a href=#fn-9>9</a></sup> with mean pooling to generate dense vector representations of sentences. For an input sequence \(\mathbf{X} = [\mathbf{x}_1, ..., \mathbf{x}_n]\), the multi-head attention mechanism calculates:<p>\[ \text{Attention}(\mathbf{Q}, \mathbf{K}, \mathbf{V}) = \text{softmax}\left(\frac{\mathbf{Q}\mathbf{K}^T}{\sqrt{d_k}}\right)\mathbf{V} \]<p>where \(\mathbf{Q}\) (queries), \(\mathbf{K}\) (keys) and \(\mathbf{V}\) (values) are linear projections of the input, and \(d_k\) is the dimension of the keys.<p>The final document representation is obtained by averaging all token representations,<p>\[ \mathbf{e}_d = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n} \mathbf{h}_i \]<p>where \(\mathbf{h}_i\) is the contextualized representation of token \(i\) in the transformer's last layer, and \(\mathbf{e}_d \in \mathbb{R}^{384}\) is the document's final embedding.<h2 id=uniform-manifold-approximation-and-projection-umap>Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP)</h2><p>UMAP reduces embedding dimensionality while preserving local and global topological structures. The algorithm is based on Riemannian manifold theory and algebraic topology<sup class=footnote-reference id=fr-4-2><a href=#fn-4>4</a></sup>. For each point \(x_i\), a normalized distance to the \(k\) nearest neighbors is defined,<p>\[ d_i(x_i, x_j) = \max\left(0, \frac{\Vert x_i - x_j \Vert - \rho_i}{\sigma_i}\right) \]<p>where \(\rho_i\) is the distance to the nearest neighbor and \(\sigma_i\) is a normalization factor.<p>The connection probability between \(x_i\) and \(x_j\) in high-dimensional space is<p>\[ w_{ij} = \exp(-d_i(x_i, x_j)) \]<p>UMAP minimizes cross-entropy divergence between high and low-dimensional graphs via<p>\[ \mathcal{L} = \sum_{i,j} w_{ij} \log\left(\frac{w_{ij}}{v_{ij}}\right) + (1-w_{ij})\log\left(\frac{1-w_{ij}}{1-v_{ij}}\right) \]<p>where \(v_{ij}\) are the weights in low-dimensional space, calculated analogously.<h2 id=hierarchical-dbscan-hdbscan>Hierarchical DBSCAN (HDBSCAN)</h2><p>HDBSCAN is a density-based hierarchical clustering algorithm that identifies clusters of different densities and sizes<sup class=footnote-reference id=fr-5-2><a href=#fn-5>5</a></sup>. For two points \(x_i\) and \(x_j\), the mutual reachability distance is defined as<p>\[ d_{\text{mreach}-k}(x_i, x_j) = \max \left\{ \text{core}_k(x_i), \text{core}_k(x_j), d(x_i, x_j) \right\} \]<p>where \(\text{core}_k(x_i)\) is the distance to the \(k\)-th nearest neighbor of \(x_i\) (with \(k\) = <code>min_cluster_size</code>).<p>The algorithm constructs a minimum spanning tree (MST) over the complete graph with weights \(d_{\text{mreach}-k}\). The MST minimizes<p>\[ \sum_{(i,j) \in \text{MST}} d_{\text{mreach}-k}(x_i, x_j) \]<p>Then, edges are iteratively removed from the MST in descending order of weight, creating a hierarchy of clusters. For each level \(\epsilon\), a cluster is stable if its "persistence" (number of points multiplied by lifetime) is high.<p>The Excess of Mass (EOM) method selects clusters that maximize:<p>\[ \text{Stability}(C) = \sum_{x_i \in C} (\lambda_{x_i} - \lambda_{\text{birth}}) \]<p>where \(\lambda = 1/\epsilon\) is the inverse density parameter, and \(\lambda_{\text{birth}}\) is the density when the cluster is born in the hierarchy.<p>Points that do not belong to any stable cluster are classified as outliers.<h2 id=class-based-tf-idf-c-tf-idf>Class-based TF-IDF (c-TF-IDF)</h2><p>BERTopic uses a variation of traditional TF-IDF adapted for clustering contexts. While traditional TF-IDF operates at the document level, c-TF-IDF treats each cluster as a single "document":<p>\[ W_{t,c} = tf_{t,c} \times \log\left(\frac{m}{df_t}\right) \]<p>where \(W_{t,c}\) is the weight of term \(t\) in cluster \(c\), \(tf_{t,c}\) is the sum of term frequencies in all documents of the cluster, \(m\) is the total number of clusters, and \(df_t\) is the number of clusters containing term \(t\).<p>This approach allows extraction of terms that are distinctive of each cluster, generating interpretable representations of identified topics.<h1 id=methodology>Methodology</h1><h2 id=system-architecture>System Architecture</h2><p>The developed system implements a modular pipeline-based architecture, organized into five distinct stages corresponding to Bardin's methodology phases adapted to the computational context:</p><script src=https://rodolfoviana.com.br/js/mermaid.js></script><pre class=mermaid>

The first is the high outlier rate of 33.9%. This suggests the need for hyperparameter fine-tuning or a hierarchical approach. The second concerns temporal bias: the concentration of documents in recent years may distort trends; finally, granularity may impact results, as some topics are very specific, others too broad.<h1 id=conclusions>Conclusions</h1><p>This work demonstrated the viability and effectiveness of integrating Bardin's classic Content Analysis methodology with modern Deep Learning techniques for analyzing large volumes of academic production. The developed system successfully processed 13,112 Unesp TCCs, identifying 188 distinct topics and revealing significant temporal, geographic, and disciplinary patterns.<p>The analysis revealed a comprehensive panorama of Unesp's undergraduate academic production in the last decade. The 188 identified topics covered 66.1% of the corpus (8,661 documents), demonstrating BERTopic's effectiveness in capturing latent thematic structures in Portuguese academic texts. Topic distribution revealed clear disciplinary segmentation, with the most prevalent topic (Arts) representing 527 documents, followed by Agronomy (381) and Urban Geography (344).<p>Temporal analysis demonstrated the system's capability to detect emerging trends, the most emblematic case being Topic 4 (COVID-19), which showed explosive growth from 2020, capturing 190 documents related to the pandemic. Topics with the highest growth identified included Algorithms and Electrical Networks (Topic 182), Fishing and Marine Biodiversity (Topic 60), Veterinary Parasitology (Topic 138), reflecting emerging research areas and practical training.<p>Geographic distribution of topics revealed distinct regional specializations. The Institute of Biosciences demonstrated strong vocation for biodiversity and conservation studies (5.9% of documents in Topic 10), while the Faculty of Engineering stood out in industrial management and lean manufacturing (8.9% in Topic 3). Particularly notable was the concentration of arts studies at the Faculty of Architecture, Arts, Communication and Design (37.6% in Topic 0), and the predominance of geology at the Institute of Geosciences and Exact Sciences (21.3% in Topic 6).<p>Despite promising results, the work presents limitations that should be considered. The outlier rate of 33.9% suggests that a significant portion of documents has very specific or interdisciplinary content that does not fit into identified clusters. This may indicate the need for hyperparameter adjustments or implementation of hierarchical clustering approaches.<p>Temporal bias, with document concentration in recent years (2,771 in 2023 and 2,311 in 2024), may reflect improvements in the repository submission process, but may also distort long-term trend analysis. Future studies could benefit from temporal normalization techniques or more sophisticated time series analysis.<h1 id=references>References</h1><section class=footnotes><ol class=footnotes-list><li id=fn-1><p>BARDIN, L. <em>Content Analysis</em>.
